        <h2>Instructions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the CraftBukkit .jar file is located in a 'craftbukkit' folder in your home directory on your server computer</li>
<li>Rename the CraftBukkit .jar file to <code>craftbukkit.jar</code>.</li>
<li>Download all the keylime.py files from the GitHub repository.</li>
<li>Set up a GMail account for your server.</li>
<li>Set up a Google Voice number for your server.</li>
<li>In a command line, navigate to the folder where you're storing the keylime.py files.</li>
<li>Create a file named 'emails.txt' with the emails of your server's members on separate lines.</li>
<li>Type <code>python keylime.py</code> in your command line.</li>
<li>Type in the information that the program asks you for. You can find your external IP address at <a href="http://www.whatismyipaddress.com">www.whatismyipaddress.com</a>.</li>
<li>Enjoy a fully automated server!</li>
</ul><h2>Features</h2>

<p>keylime.py knows when your server is not running, and automatically emails server members about the server's downtime. keylime.py also knows when/if your server's IP address has changed, and emails server members a notice about that.</p>

<p>For remote server management, keylime.py allows you to email commands to be run on your server. Just send an email to your server's GMail account with the authentication code as the subject, and the server command as the message. You'll receive a confirmation email with the new authentication code.</p>

<p>You can also text commands to your server! Send a text to your server's Google Voice number with the authentication code, then a space, then the server command you want to run. You'll receive a confirmation text, and a text with the new authentication code.</p>

<p>Happy Crafting!</p>
